    description: "The Tesla Cybertruck represents one of the most radical departures from conventional vehicle design in modern automotive history, featuring an angular, polygonal exoskeleton made from Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless steelâ€”the same material used in SpaceX rockets. First unveiled as a prototype in 2019 but reaching production in late 2023 after multiple delays, the Cybertruck's dystopian-inspired design eliminates the need for traditional body stamping and paint, with the unpainted stainless steel body serving as both structure and exterior finish. Measuring approximately 223.7 inches long, 79.8 inches wide, and 70.5 inches tall, the Cybertruck features a variable ride height of up to 16 inches through its adaptive air suspension, providing significant ground clearance for off-road use while capable of lowering for improved highway aerodynamics and easier access. Initially launched in dual-motor AWD and tri-motor 'Cyberbeast' configurations (with a delayed single-motor variant planned), the production Cybertruck delivers 600-845 horsepower depending on variant, enabling 0-60 mph acceleration as quick as 2.6 seconds in the Cyberbeast. The 123 kWh battery pack provides approximately
240-300 miles of range depending on configuration, with 250 kW DC fast-charging capability. The minimalist interior features a 18.5-inch central touchscreen, 9.4-inch rear screen, and a yoke-style steering control, with seating for up to five adults and a fully powered tonneau cover concealing the 6.5-foot cargo bed. Innovative features include four-wheel steering with crab-walk capability, a 48-volt electrical architecture, and a claimed towing capacity of up to 11,000 pounds. The Cybertruck's development journey was marked by numerous challenges in bringing its unconventional design to production, requiring the creation of entirely new manufacturing techniques and compromises from the original concept, yet the final product maintains the provocative aesthetic and performance ambitions that generated unprecedented interest upon its unveiling. As Tesla's entry into the lucrative pickup truck market, the Cybertruck represents a high-stakes gamble on whether truck buyers will embrace its radical departure from traditional pickup design and capabilities."
