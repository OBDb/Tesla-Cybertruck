    description: "The Tesla Cybertruck is a battery-electric full-size pickup truck manufactured by Tesla since 2023. It was first unveiled as a prototype in November 2019, featuring a distinctive angular design composed of flat, unpainted stainless steel body panels. After multiple delays, production began at Gigafactory Texas in November 2023, with initial customer deliveries occurring that same month. The Cybertruck is offered in three variants: a single-motor rear-wheel drive (RWD) 'Long Range' model, a dual-motor all-wheel drive (AWD) model, and a tri-motor AWD model marketed as the 'Cyberbeast'. The vehicle features an exoskeleton construction using 30X cold-rolled stainless steel, eliminating the need for traditional body stamping. Measuring approximately 223.7 inches long, 79.8 inches wide, and 70.5 inches tall, it features adjustable air suspension (on AWD and Cyberbeast trims) with up to 17 inches of ground clearance. Power outputs range from approximately 600 hp in the Long Range to 845 hp in the Cyberbeast, enabling 0-60 mph acceleration as quick as 2.6 seconds. The 123 kWh structural battery pack provides an estimated EPA range of 250-340 miles depending on configuration. Notable features include steer-by-wire with a yoke-style steering wheel, four-wheel steering with up to 10 degrees of rear-wheel articulation, and up to 9.6 kW of vehicle-to-load power output. The Cybertruck represents Tesla's entry into the pickup truck market, with a claimed towing capacity of up to 11,000 pounds and a payload capacity of approximately 2,500 pounds."
